\section{Entire State}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Have not found dataset or source for polling locations across the state that is not current
  \item \href{https://registration.elections.myflorida.com/CheckVoterStatus}{Find polling location page here}, search function navigates to individual SoE websites for polling location, not easily web-scraped
  \item would only be current
  \item While also current, it does seem that voterfocus.com has lists of current voting locations by precinct for each county in florida (linked to by SOE sites) but you're redirected if you don't go to the specific county address. Could be used to create a database in the future

\section{Individual Counties}

\subsection{Current Recommendations}

Without historical polling locations at the moment, I feel Alachua county, and potentially a few smaller counties, are our best bet.  We could do Alachua without the recently changed polling locations for multiple elections. With precincts having last been updated in 2016 it seems reasonable that no other polling locations have changed since then. We might also be able to see if there is a notable difference in turnout for the precincts that had a change of polling location.
