###Intro

This document will go through how to webscrape for a single Florida county's currently polling locations for each precinct from voterfocus.com. In this case we will be using Alachua. After that we'll scrape polling locations for all Florida counties (with the exception of Orange and Sarasota counties). For a basic guide on how to webscrape see this link: [https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginners-guide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/]
