# PollDistance

The goal of this project was to search for historical polling location data and streamline the collection of current polling locations in the state of Florida. No certain historical data is in this project but some guesses can be found in the notes. The "Webscraper" rmd file works and has details on how current polling location data is collected, as well as the latest limitations on that data collection. Feel free to run the file yourself for the latest data or look at FLPollPlace file for the last data that was webscraped by myself.
